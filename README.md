<p>
The Conference Room Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage and display the status of conference rooms within a building. Utilizing Java Swing for the graphical user interface and JDBC for database connectivity, this system allows users to interact with a dynamic interface where each button represents a room on a specific floor. Upon clicking a room button, the application queries an Oracle database to retrieve and display the current status of the selected room. The code demonstrates a seamless integration of front-end and back-end components, highlighting skills in Java event handling, SQL querying, and exception management.
